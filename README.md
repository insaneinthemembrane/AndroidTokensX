Android Tokens X
===================


AndroidTokensX is a free coin, made with much respect to the original developers of Android Tokens and Android Token V2.  They were great ideas and brightened up Cryptsy considerably.

Unlike the originals, ADTX is free but being free does not mean worthless. ADTX will succeed, be listed on an exchange with volume, and will be dumped, pumped and come out the other end still breathing, with a  new lease for life.

AndroidTokensX Specifications

There are a few differences between versions original  and 2, mainly because it would be rude to just clone **their** coin. So it is altered to suit an airdrop, and for longevity.
